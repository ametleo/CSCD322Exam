# WhatsApp Clone

After watching a Rocketseat tutorial on how to clone Nubank's app interface,
I decided to clone some other interface but full by myself.

Here is how it is so far:

### How to run

Choose a folder and clone the project executing: 
```
git clone https://github.com/lliuti/whatsapp-mobile-clone.git
```

enter the project folder (_cd whatsapp-mobile-clone_)

to install all dependencies, run
```
yarn 
```

and to execute it:
```
yarn start
```

Also, keep in mind that I'm using expo and android studio to emulate the app.
